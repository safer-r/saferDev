# Extract All Function Names

Extract all function names.

## Usage

``` r
.extract_all_fun_names(text, pattern, lib_path, error_text)
```

## Arguments

- text:

  Single string.

- pattern:

  Single string of a Perl regex to extract function names.

- lib_path:

  Vector of characters specifying the absolute pathways of the
  directories containing the required packages for the function, if not
  in the default directories. Useful when R packages are not installed
  in the default directories because of lack of admin rights. More
  precisely, `lib_path` is passed through the `new` argument of
  [`.libPaths()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/libPaths.html) so that the new
  library paths are `unique(c(new, .Library.site, .Library))`. Warning:
  [`.libPaths()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/libPaths.html) is restored to
  the initial paths, after function execution. Ignored if `NULL`
  (default): only the pathways specified by the current
  [`.libPaths()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/libPaths.html) are used for
  package calling.

- error_text:

  Single character string used to add information in error messages
  returned by the function, notably if the function is inside other
  functions, which is practical for debugging. Example:
  `error_text = " INSIDE <PACKAGE_1>::<FUNCTION_1> INSIDE <PACKAGE_2>::<FUNCTION_2>."`.
  If `NULL`, converted into `""`.

## Value

List containing:

- `string`: the function names without parenthesis.

- `pos`: position of the first character of the function names in the
  input string

## Details

Warnings:

- requires [`saferDev::arg_check`](arg_check.md).

- In the safer Backbone section
  `"######## check of the required functions from the required packages"`,
  add also [`saferDev::arg_check`](arg_check.md) when checking for the
  presence of `.extract_all_fun_names`.
