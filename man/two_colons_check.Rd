\usage{
two_colons_check(x, safer_check = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a function name, written without quotes and brackets.}

\item{safer_check}{Single logical value. Perform some "safer" checks (see https://github.com/safer-r) ? If TRUE, two_colons_check() checks before running that 1) the R scope for R operators (like "<-") is not overwritten by another package and 2) functions and related packages used are present in R lybraries. Set to FALSE if two_colons_check() is used inside another "safer" function to avoid pointless multiple checking.}
}
\value{
A message indicating the missing ::

- §problem: logical. Is there any problem detected?

- §text: message indicating the details of the problem, or the absence of problem.

- §object.name: value of the data.name argument (i.e., name of the checked object if provided, NULL otherwise).
}
\description{
Verify that all the functions used inside a function are all referenced by their package attribution. For instance: base::mean()
}
\details{
- More precisely, two_colons_check() verifies that all the strings before an opening bracket "(" are preceeded by "::"

- The regex used is: "\\b[a-zA-Z.]{1}[a-zA-Z0-9._]+\\b(?= *\\()"
 
- The following R operators using bracket are not considered: "function", "if", "for", "while" and "repeat"
}
