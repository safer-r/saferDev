## Description

Set of R functions for the development of R functions, written according to the [cute_project](https://github.com/gael-millot/cute_project) specifications.

<br />

## Content

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **arg_check()** | Check expected values of arguments of functions: class, type, mode, length, restricted values panel, kind of numeric values in addition to the distinction between 'integer' and 'double' (proportion only? Inf values authorized? negative values authorized? Integers of type 'double'?). |
| **arg_test()** | Test a set of values for a defined set of arguments of a function. Contrary to `testthat::test_that()`, the function test a batch of values and control only if an error is returned or not. |
| **env_check()** | Verify that object names in the environment defined by the pos argument are identical or not to object names in the above environments (following R Scope). This can be used to verify that names used for objects inside a function or in the working environment do not override names of objects already present in the above R environments, following the R scope. |
| **get_message()** | Return the error, warning or simple (non error non warning) message if ever exist of an instruction written between quotes. |
| **is_function_here()** | Check if required functions are present in installed packages. This controls modifications in of function names package versions. |
| **is_package_here()** | Check if required packages are installed locally. |
| **is_python_package_here()** | Check if required python packages are installed locally. |
| **report()** | Print a character string or a data object into a same log file. |
